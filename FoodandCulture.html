				<h1>Philippines(food and culture)</h1>
        <p> Despite having food that has either taken its roots from another culture or has been recreated to fit the Filipino taste, the Philippines has still successfully carved its own space in the gastronomic scene. Some most notable Filipino foods include adobo, chicken or pork meat cooked in soy sauce and vinegar, and lechon or roasted whole pig, which the late Anthony Bourdain swore by as the best pig he has ever tried. There's also balut (duck embryo), a Filipino street food perfect for those who like trying exotic dishes, and halo-halo, a famous summer staple with crushed ice, milk, and sweetened fruits. Your trip to the Philippines won’t be complete without feasting on fresh (but really affordable!) seafood. If you can’t get enough fresh crabs, shrimps, and other tasty seafood dishes, do a food tour in Roxas City in Capiz, the Philippines' Seafood Capital. </p>
